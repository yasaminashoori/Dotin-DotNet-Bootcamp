numeric and decimal

In standard SQL, there is a slight difference between the NUMERIC and DECIMAL data types. However, in some variants of SQL, there is no difference! This article will clear up any confusion.

In this article, I’ll explain the differences and similarities between SQL’s standard NUMERIC and DECIMAL data types. Then I’ll discuss how these data types work in common SQL dialects. We’ve already posted a more general article on SQL data types; this time, we’ll drill down further on just the DECIMAL and NUMERIC data types.

If you're looking for a comprehensive SQL course, I recommend the interactive SQL from A to Z learning path. It contains over 800 exercises and covers the basic, intermediate, and advanced topics of SQL. Learn all modern SQL in one place!
